const SunAlso = `Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton.
Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title,
but it meant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked it,
but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority
and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton. There was a
certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock down anybody who was snooty to him,
although, being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym.
He was Spider Kelly's star pupil. Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box like featherweights,
no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five or two hundred and five pounds.
But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really very fast. He was so good that Spider promptly
overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened. This increased Cohn's distaste
for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it
certainly improved his nose. In his last year at Princeton he read too much and
took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his class who remembered him.
They did not even remember that he was middleweight boxing champion.
I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together,
and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion,
and that perhaps a horse had stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or seen something, or that he had, maybe,
bumped into something as a young child, but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly.
Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had become of him.
Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest Jewish
families in New York, and through his mother of one of the oldest.
At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and played a very good
end on the football team, no one had made him race-conscious.
No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence any different from anybody
else, until he went to Princeton. He was a nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy,
and it made him bitter. He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton
with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the
first girl who was nice to him. He was married five years, had three children,
lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance of the
estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather unattractive mould under
domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just when he had made up his mind to
leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniature-painter. As he had been
thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be
too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.
The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast.
In California he fell among literary people and, as he still had a little of the
fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of the Arts.
The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and finished in
Provincetown, Massachusetts. By that time Cohn, who had been regarded purely
as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the editorial page merely as a
member of the advisory board, had become the sole editor. It was his money and
he discovered he liked the authority of editing. He was sorry when the magazine
became too expensive and he had to give it up. By that time, though, he had other
things to worry about. He had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with
the magazine. She was very forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being
taken in hand. Also he was sure that he loved her. When this lady saw that the
magazine was not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and
decided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was still
something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where Cohn could write.
They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated, and stayed three years.
During these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris,
Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary
friend. I was his tennis friend. The lady who had him, her name was Frances,
found toward the end of the second year that her looks were going, and her
attitude toward Robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation
to the absolute determination that he should marry her. During this time Robert's
mother had settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month.
During two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at another
woman. He was fairly happy, except that, like many people living in Europe,
he would rather have been in America, and he had discovered writing.`
